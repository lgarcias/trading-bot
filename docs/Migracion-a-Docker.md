# Project Migration Plan to Docker

## Objective

Containerize the entire application (backend, frontend, and database) using Docker and Docker Compose to facilitate deployment, portability, and both local and production development.

---

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

- **Windows/Mac:**
  - Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- **Linux:**
  - Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
    sudo systemctl enable --now docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    # Log out and log back in to apply the group
    ```

### 2. Create the `Dockerfile` for the backend
- Define how to build your backend image (FastAPI, etc.).
- Include dependencies, copy the code, and expose the required port.

### 3. Create the `Dockerfile` for the frontend (optional)
- If you have a React frontend, create a Dockerfile to serve it (e.g., with nginx or node).

### 4. Create the `docker-compose.yml` file
- Orchestrate the services: backend, frontend (optional), and database (PostgreSQL recommended).
- Define environment variables, volumes, and networks.

### 5. Configure environment variables
- Use `.env` files for credentials and sensitive configuration.
- Do not commit `.env` files to git.

### 6. Adapt the app to read environment configuration
- Ensure the app reads environment variables for database connection and other services.

### 7. Test the environment locally
- Start everything with:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
- Access the app and verify that everything works.

### 8. Document the Docker workflow
- How to develop, test, and deploy using Docker.
- How to access the database and logs.
